# Digital_Smart_Clock
Digital smart clock built with a STM32 Nucleo Board, I2C humidity &amp; Temp. sensor, 16x2 LCD, and an RTC module utilizing FreeRTOS w/ multi-threading. The I2C, LCD and RTC drivers were all written from scratch using the STM32 HAL, ARM CMSIS and C programming. FreeRTOS is being used to calculate temp, time, date and humidity data in one thread and LCD display is on another thread. The CMSIS RTOS V2 library is being used to communicate with FreeRTOS and conduct any thread sync. The smart clock displays temp, humidity, date and time on the LCD, the time and date can be set in the firmware itself. The firmware is cross compiled for ARM using the gnu arm toolchain.
